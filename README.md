The Food Waste Management System is a project aimed at collecting excess or leftover food from donors, such as hotels, restaurants, and marriage halls, and distributing it to needy people to help reduce food wastage. This system comprises three main modules: User, Admin, and Delivery. The User module is designed for individuals or organizations willing to donate their excess food. It allows users to register, log in, and donate food by selecting the type and quantity. The system matches donations with nearby needy individuals or organizations, enabling users to view and track their contributions. The Admin module is for NGOs, trusts, and charities registered on the platform. Administrators manage the food donation process, including viewing and managing donation lists and matching donations to requests from NGOs and charities. Admins can track requests and oversee food distribution. The Delivery module enables delivery personnel to register and provide pickup and drop-off services for food donations. It displays the pickup and drop-off locations, ensuring seamless logistics.

This system is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, PHP for the backend, and a MySQL database, hosted on a XAMPP server. The project features a mobile-friendly design, chatbot support, and secure login functionality. To run the project: download the project zip file, extract it, and paste the folder into the root directory of your webserver (e.g., xampp/htdocs for XAMPP). Open PHPMyAdmin, create a database, and import the demo.sql file (inside the database folder). Finally, run the script at http://localhost/folderName. This system effectively addresses food waste and promotes community welfare by redistributing excess food to those in need.
